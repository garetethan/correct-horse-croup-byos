# Correct Horse Croup Byos

Usage: `python3 correct.py wiktionary-en.json`

I like the password creation method [suggested by xkcd](https://xkcd.com/936/): use several words, because many words exist<sup>\[[citation needed](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/285:_Wikipedian_Protester)\]</sup>, and they can be easy to remember. The security of a password generated this way depends on the size of the dictionary, and the [English Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) is the largest dictionary I know of that still has reasonable inclusion criteria. So you could just [ask Wiktionary for a random English lemma](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:RandomInCategory/English_lemmas#English) several times, but then you have kind of just told Wiktionary your password. My solution to this was to download all (or nearly all) of the words and write this program to choose several of them locally.

## Wiktionary data
This program requires Wiktionary JSON data that can be downloaded from [kaikki](https://kaikki.org/dictionary/). Wikimedia makes Wiktionary's data [publicly downloadable](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/). [Tatu Ylonen](https://github.com/tatuylonen) made [Wiktextract](https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract), which processes Wiktionary's downloads and turns them into JSON data. These JSON files are then hosted on kaikki. I made [rmBaggage.py](rmBaggage.py), which removes data from the JSON file that Correct Horse Croup Byos does not need. [wiktionary-en.json](wiktionary-en.json) is this trimmed-down version of the English-only download from kaikki. As such, you should not have any use for [rmBaggage.py](rmBaggage.py) unless you are using a different data file. See [the license file](LICENSE.md) for the copyright information of the Wiktionary data.

## Security
I do not fully understand the security implications of printing passwords in plain text in a terminal (as Correct Horse Croup Byos does), so unless you do, I suggest that you **do not trust passwords generated by this program**, and use at your own risk.

## Name
The name was [inspired by xkcd](https://xkcd.com/936/). *croup* and *byos* were words selected randomly by [the main program](correct.py).
